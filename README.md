## Digital hardware projects

Open-source digital hardware projects. 

### ODIN Spiking Neural Network (SNN) Processor

<a href="https://open-neuromorphic.org/neuromorphic-computing/hardware/odin-frenkel/"><img src="images/odin-frenkel.png" alt="odin-frenkel" width="500"/></a>

[ODIN](https://open-neuromorphic.org/neuromorphic-computing/hardware/odin-frenkel/) is an online-learning digital spiking neuromorphic processor designed and prototyped in 28-nm FDSOI CMOS at Université catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain), published in 2019 in the IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems journal. ODIN is based on a single 256-neuron 64k-synapse crossbar neurosynaptic core with the following key features:

- synapses embed spike-dependent synaptic plasticity (SDSP)-based online learning,
- neurons can phenomenologically reproduce the 20 Izhikevich behaviors.

ODIN is thus a versatile experimentation platform for learning at the edge, while demonstrating (i) record neuron and synapse densities compared to all previously-proposed spiking neural networks (SNNs) and (ii) the lowest energy per synaptic operation across previously-proposed digital SNNs.

### ReckOn: A Spiking RNN Processor Enabling On-Chip Learning over Second-Long Timescales

<a href="https://open-neuromorphic.org/neuromorphic-computing/hardware/reckon-frenkel/"><img src="images/reckon-frenkel.png" alt="reckon-frenkel" width="500"/></a>

[ReckOn](https://open-neuromorphic.org/neuromorphic-computing/hardware/reckon-frenkel/) is a spiking recurrent neural network (RNN) processor enabling on-chip learning over second-long timescales based on a modified version of the e-prop algorithm (we released a PyTorch implementation of the vanilla e-prop algorithm for leaky integrate-and-fire neurons here). It was prototyped and measured in 28-nm FDSOI CMOS at the Institute of Neuroinformatics, University of Zurich and ETH Zurich, and published at the 2022 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC) with the following three main claims:

- ReckOn demonstrates end-to-end on-chip learning over second-long timescales while keeping a milli-second temporal resolution,
- it provides a low-cost solution with a 0.45-mm² core area, 5.3pJ/SOP at 0.5V, and a memory overhead of only 0.8% compared to the equivalent inference-only network,
- it exploits a spike-based representation for task-agnostic learning toward user customization and chip repurposing at the edge.

### RANC - Reconfigurable Architecture for Neuromorphic Computing

<img src="images/ranc.png" alt="ranc" width="500"/>

[RANC](https://ua-rcl.github.io/projects/ranc/) is a highly flexible environment that enables rapid experimentation with neuromorphic architectures in both software via C++ simulation and hardware via FPGA emulation. RANC enables hardware architects and application engineers to investigate and tune parameters of their neuromorphic architecture that would otherwise be unavailable on a purely prefabricated ASIC. This level of flexibility creates an environment that allows for optimizing architectures based on application insights as well as prototyping future neuromorphic architectures that can support new classes of applications entirely.

### SNE: an Energy-Proportional Digital Accelerator for Sparse Event-Based Convolutions 

<img src="images/sne-di-mauro.png" alt="sne-di-mauro" width="500"/>

[SNE](https://github.com/pulp-platform/sne) is a novel digital sparse neural engine (SNE) to efficiently accelerate SNN inference tasks at the extreme edge. The accelerator exploits an explicit input event temporal and spatial location encoding; the SNE architecture is designed to improve input data and weight reuse, reducing the traffic towards the memory. SNE achieves a maximum performance of 51.2 GSOP/s, and an energy efficiency of 4.5TSOP/s/W. Ultimately, SNE shows 3.55X higher energy efficiency than SoA neuromorphic platform [16], approaching classical DNN accelerators energy efficiencies, while performing energy-proportional computations. As a proof of concept, it is shown that SNE consumes 0.221 pJ/SOP and achieves 92.8% accuracy on a classification task performed on the IBM DVS-Gesture data set.

### OpenSpike: An OpenRAM SNN AcceleratorOpenSpike

<img src="images/OpenSpike.png" alt="OpenSpike"/>

This paper presents a spiking neural network (SNN) accelerator made using fully open-source EDA tools, process design kit (PDK), and memory macros synthesized using OpenRAM. The chip is taped out in the 130 nm SkyWater process and integrates over 1 million synaptic weights, and offers a reprogrammable architecture. It operates at a clock speed of 40 MHz, a supply of 1.8 V, uses a PicoRV32 core for control, and occupies an area of 33.3 mm^2. The throughput of the accelerator is 48,262 images per second with a wallclock time of 20.72 us, at 56.8 GOPS/W. The spiking neurons use hysteresis to provide an adaptive threshold (i.e., a Schmitt trigger) which can reduce state instability. This results in high performing SNNs across a range of benchmarks that remain competitive with state-of-the-art, full precision SNNs. The design is open source and [available online](https://github.com/sfmth/OpenSpike).
